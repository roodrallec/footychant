## Description
We created the Footy Chants extension for all the football fans out there who are missing the atmosphere from football games.

## Usage

Footy Chants is a free chrome extension that you can install from the chrome webstore. Once installed and enabled, click on the chrome extension icon and select your team. You should begin to hear background crowd sounds mixed in with your team's chants.

## Credits
Although the app itself is non-commercial and the code open source, the chant audio was sourced from: https://www.fanchants.com/

If you have any suggestions or feedback, raise a Github issue!
